  // Justin Bieber — YUKON
  "6Z3iROBd8ULQRJymXD8gdg": `[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
In the city, uh
'Member you used to drive a Yukon
I pick up whenever you call
In the parking lot in Tucson, like
"Uh, are you with me?"
In the Phantom with the roof gone
I pull up like Jimmy Neutron
I can help you get a move on like U-Haul
And I know

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Uh, you like to go slow
But we could go faster
Tell me the password
Slide city, slide city
You know what that means, uh
I'm coming up on you quickly, mm
I bring nice things, uh
Slide city, slide
Plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So I'ma get slouched instead
I know it's gon' makе you beg

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What would I do (What would I do?)
If I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do if I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do (What would I do?)
If I didn't lovе you?

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & 2 Chainz]
Mm-mm (Yeah)
Mm

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & 2 Chainz]
Just wanna be the one to give you what you want
I could put you in the Yves Saint Laurent
Riding 'round town with your hair done up (True)
I know you like it when I tell you what you want
Keep your plan, what you're doin' with me tomorrow?
I can tell your friends you need your mantra
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & 2 Chainz]
Uh, you like to go slow
But we could go faster
Tell me the password (Uh)
Slide city, slide city
You know what that means, uh
I'm coming up on you quickly, mm
I bring nice things (Yeah; baby, I bring nice things)
Slide city, slide
Plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So I'ma get slouched instead
I know it's gon' make you beg`,
  // Frank Ocean — Self Control
  "5GUYJTQap5F3RDQiCOJhrS": `[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Poolside convo about your summer last night (Ooh, yeah)
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein & Frank Ocean, Austin Feinstein]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Sometimes, you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it (Yeah)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it`,

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 visions
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind (Yeah)
I said, I said

You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(Uh-huh)

Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)

Stop the waitin' 'fore I stop the chasin', like a alcoholic
"You don't understand me" – What the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes (Yeah) (Woo)
